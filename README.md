## 👋 Hey, I’m **Lucaza**

I’m a **secondary school student** and the creator of **OpenCode** — a next-gen programming language and IDE designed for creativity, speed, and flexibility.  
I’m also on the autism spectrum, and that gives me a *supercharged focus* for logic, structure, and detail — the kind of mindset that’s perfect for building languages from scratch 🧠⚙️.

## 🚀 What Is OpenCode?

**OpenCode** is more than an IDE — it’s a **modular coding ecosystem**.  
It introduces a new file type: `.oc` — built on top of **Python**, designed for readability and modularity.  

You can think of it as:
> 🧩 *Python’s simplicity meets modern IDE power.*

OpenCode lets you build programs using reusable **function modules**, run them instantly, and extend the language itself — without touching the core engine.
